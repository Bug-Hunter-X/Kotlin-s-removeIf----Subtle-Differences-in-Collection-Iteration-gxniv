The provided code correctly demonstrates the `removeIf` function behavior with Lists, Maps, and Sets.  To handle potential issues and ensure predictable results, consider these strategies:

1. **Create a copy:** Before modifying the collection, create a copy to avoid issues with concurrent modification. 

2. **Iterate using indices:** For lists, iterate using indices to avoid unexpected behavior during removal.

3. **Alternative approach:** Instead of `removeIf`, consider creating a new collection containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.

Example of an alternative approach:
```kotlin
fun main() {
    val list = mutableListOf<Int>(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    val filteredList = list.filter { it % 2 != 0 }
    println(filteredList) // Output: [1, 3, 5]
}
```
This approach offers better readability and avoids the potential pitfalls associated with `removeIf`.
